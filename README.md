# Portfolio-Optimization-using-Machine-Learning

## Introduction
The main aim of the project is to identify whether predictive analysis using Machine Learning helps in better construction of optimized portfolio using Modern Portfolio Theory.
In this project, we first aim to construct optimized portfolios using three approaches viz unaided portfolio, aided portfolio (predictive modelling using ML) and complete information portfolio which involves the actual data instead of predicted data using Machine Learning. The study would further involve comparing these portfolios and analyzing whether Machine Learning helps in better construction of portfolios or not.

## Data
We have considered 6 different stocks from different sectors including Technology, FMCG, Oil and Gas and Banking, for our portfolio construction so as to ensure proper sector diversification of our portfolio. 
We have downloaded the data using the yahoo finance library in pyhton.

## Tech Stack/Frameworks
Data Cleaning: NumPy, Pandas

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning Models: Random Forest, Linear Regression

## Conclusion
By using appropriate predictive models we can get a good idea about the future stock prices, and thus that would help us construct better optimized portfolios which would enable us to make well informed investment decisions.
Overall, this project highlights the importance of utilizing data-driven approaches to make well informed financial decisons and it also highlights the importance of Machine Learning in the financial sector. The findings of this study prove that modern portfolio theory aided with Machine Learning helps in better construction of optimized portfolios.
